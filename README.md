# 👋 Hey, I'm Dylinh

I'm a 20-year-old Computer Science student at Wilfrid Laurier University (Class of 2026) with a passion for software development, automation, and clean, efficient code. I’m always building, learning, and trying to level up both technically and personally.

Outside of code, I’m into photography, fitness, and finding new ways to grow socially and professionally.
